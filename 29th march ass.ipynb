    "Lasso (short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\") Regression is a regression technique that involves adding a penalty term to the regression equation to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. It is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to shrink the regression coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, in the way that it selects the subset of predictor variables that are most relevant to the response variable. Unlike Ridge Regression, which shrinks all the regression coefficients towards zero, Lasso Regression sets some of the regression coefficients exactly to zero. This makes Lasso Regression useful for feature selection, as it can identify the most important variables in the model and eliminate the less important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression also differs from OLS regression in the way that it handles multicollinearity, which is a common issue when there are highly correlated predictor variables in the model. OLS regression tends to give large coefficients to highly correlated variables, which can lead to unstable estimates and poor generalization performance. Lasso Regression, on the other hand, can select only one of the highly correlated variables and set the coefficients of the others to zero, which helps to improve the model's stability and interpretability.\n",

    "Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model is similar to interpreting the coefficients of a linear regression model. However, because some of the coefficients may be exactly zero, it is important to consider which variables have non-zero coefficients and which have zero coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables with non-zero coefficients are considered to be important predictors of the response variable and are positively or negatively associated with the response, depending on the sign of their coefficient. For example, if the coefficient for the variable \"age\" is positive, it means that as age increases, the response variable is likely to increase as well. On the other hand, if the coefficient for the variable \"income\" is negative, it means that as income increases, the response variable is likely to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables with zero coefficients are considered to be irrelevant or redundant predictors of the response variable and can be excluded from the model without affecting its performance. For example, if the coefficient for the variable \"education level\" is zero, it means that this variable does not have a significant effect on the response variable and can be excluded from the model.\n",

Larger coefficients indicate stronger associations between the predictor and the response variable, while smaller coefficients indicate weaker associations.\n",

    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, also known as lambda. Lambda controls the strength of the penalty term in the regression equation, which determines the amount of shrinkage applied to the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "When lambda is set to zero, Lasso Regression reduces to ordinary least squares regression and all the predictor variables are included in the model. As lambda increases, the penalty term becomes more important, and the magnitude of the regression coefficients is reduced. When lambda is set to a very large value, all the regression coefficients are shrunk to zero, and the model becomes a constant value.\n",

    "The choice of lambda can have a significant impact on the model's performance. If lambda is set too high, the model may underfit the data, meaning that it is too simple and does not capture the true relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable. On the other hand, if lambda is set too low, the model may overfit the data, meaning that it is too complex and captures noise or irrelevant features in the data.\n",

    "Lasso Regression is primarily a linear regression technique and is therefore best suited for linear regression problems.

Ridge Regression uses an L2 penalty term, which adds the sum of the squares of the coefficients to the cost function being optimized.

In contrast, Lasso Regression uses an L1 penalty term, which adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function being optimized.
